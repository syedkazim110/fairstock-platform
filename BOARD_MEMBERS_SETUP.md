# Board Members Feature - Setup Instructions

## Overview
The board member management feature has been successfully implemented. This feature allows company owners to add board members who can view company information and the cap table (but cannot make changes).

## What Was Created

### 1. Database Policy Updates (`supabase-add-board-member-policies.sql`)
- Updated RLS policies to allow board members to view companies
- Updated company_members policies for proper access control

### 2. Components
- **AddBoardMemberModal** (`components/company/AddBoardMemberModal.tsx`)
  - Modal to add board members by email
  - Validates that the user exists before adding
  - Sets status to 'active' immediately (no invitation flow yet)

- **RemoveMemberButton** (`components/company/RemoveMemberButton.tsx`)
  - Button to remove board members
  - Confirmation dialog before removal

### 3. Pages
- **Members Management Page** (`app/company/[id]/members/page.tsx`)
  - Lists all company members (owner + board members)
  - Add/remove board members functionality
  - Only accessible to company owners

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Apply Database Policies
You need to apply the SQL policies to your Supabase database. Open your Supabase dashboard and execute the SQL in `supabase-add-board-member-policies.sql`:

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `supabase-add-board-member-policies.sql`
4. Execute the SQL

This will update the RLS policies to allow board members to access companies.

### Step 2: Test the Feature
1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   cd fairstock-platform
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Log in as a company owner
3. Go to one of your companies
4. Click "Manage Members" button
5. Click "Add Board Member"
6. Enter the email of an existing user
7. The board member should now see the company in their "Board Memberships" section

## How It Works

1. **Adding Board Members**:
   - Owner goes to `/company/[id]/members`
   - Clicks "Add Board Member"
   - Enters email of existing user
   - System creates a `company_members` entry with:
     - `role: 'board_member'`
     - `status: 'active'`
     - `invited_by: owner's user_id`

2. **Board Member Access**:
   - Board members can view companies in the "Board Memberships" section of their dashboard
   - They can view company details and cap table
   - They cannot make any changes (only owners can)
   - RLS policies ensure they only see companies they're members of

3. **Removing Board Members**:
   - Owner can remove board members from the members page
   - Board member immediately loses access to the company

## User Flow Example

### For Company Owner:
1. Create a company (if you haven't already)
2. Navigate to the company detail page
3. Click "Manage Members" (top right)
4. Click "Add Board Member" 
5. Enter email: `boardmember@example.com` (must already have an account)
6. Board member is added instantly with active status

### For Board Member:
1. Log in with the email that was added
2. Go to Dashboard
3. See the company listed under "Board Memberships"
4. Click on the company to view details and cap table
5. Notice the "Board Member" badge (not "Owner")

## Notes

- The user must already have an account (signed up) to be added as a board member
- Board members have read-only access - they cannot modify anything
- Only owners can add/remove board members
- The database already had the `company_members` table structure, so no schema changes were needed
- Status is set to 'active' immediately - there's no pending invitation flow (this could be added later if needed)

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
1. **Invitation System**: Email invitation instead of immediately adding
2. **Role Permissions**: Different levels of board member access
3. **Activity Log**: Track when members were added/removed
4. **Bulk Operations**: Add/remove multiple members at once
5. **Member Search**: Search functionality for large member lists
